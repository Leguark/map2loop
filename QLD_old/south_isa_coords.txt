Hi Mark
Here are the coordinates of the area:
https://qdexdata.dnrme.qld.gov.au/gdp/search
Min Longitude: 139.130
Max longitude: 140.119
Min latitude: -23.417
Max latitude: -22.6861
which I translated from 7490000 N to 7410000 N 
and E 310000 to E 410000
May I know which package do you recommend for creating the geological model of the area 
(Geomodeller, map2loop, GemPy or ...)?Or can we discuss it when you have time?

Regards
Mahtab
