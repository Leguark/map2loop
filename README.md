# map2loop Package

map2loop is the map deconstruction library to provide inputs to Loop ([Loop3d.org](https://loop3d.org/)). 
The development of map2loop is lead by **Mark Jessell** at The University of Western Australia. **Yohan de Rose** at Monash University is now making it better.

## What it does:
  
-  Combines information extracted from vector geology maps in various forms to support 3D geological modelling. Outputs are simple csv files that should be readable by any 3D modelling system (I think), but specific examples are provided for <a href="https://github.com/Loop3D/LoopStructural">LoopStructural</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy">gempy</a>, <a href="https://www.intrepid-geophysics.com/product/geomodeller/">geomodeller</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cgre-aachen/pynoddy">noddy</a>.

Loop is led by Laurent Ailleres (Monash University) with a team of Work Package leaders from:
* Monash University: Roy Thomson, Lachlan Grose and Robin Armit
* University of Western Australia: Mark Jessell, Jeremie Giraud, Mark Lindsay and Guillaume Pirot
* Geological Survey of Canada: Boyan Brodaric and Eric de Kemp

## This is very much a proof of concept code that is unlikely to work first time with anything but the example dataset provided, but if you would like to try it with your own data please feel free to contact me at mark.jessell@uwa.edu.au to discuss your plans.  

## For Loop partners, the fastest install path (thanks to Yohan de Rose) is via docker, go to development version at:
       
   http://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop-2    
   
## otherwise follow these instructions:
